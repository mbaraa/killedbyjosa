This project is forked from [killedbygoogle](https://github.com/codyogden/killedbygoogle), and is made as a joke, that we at JOSA (Jordan Open Source Association) kill our products, just like Google!

## Contribute

To add a product, gather the following information:

- Name of Product (`name`)
- Launch Date (`dateOpen`)
- Discontinued Date (`dateClose`)
- Description (`description`)
- Link (`link`) - Relevant link to the source.
- Type (`type`) - one of App, Service or Hardware

### Editorial Guidelines

#### Description

The description should be a single sentence describing the product. It should begin with the products name. For example, "JOSA Portal was A portal that is made specifically for you! Play around with the community's features as soon as they are shipped, supporting JOSA in developing new ones" It will be attached to a generated sentence like "Killed about 10 months ago."

Please be respectful, only use past tense.

#### Link

Link should be the resource's GitHub repository, or an [ASOJ](https://asoj.xyz) link to the resurrected service.

#### Type

The type should be either `app`, `service`, or `website` as a string.
